# src

Click `src.Rproj` to open an RStudio session and R project/workspace. Then run the code (`.Rmd` or `.R` files) from that R session/project to rerun the analyses in the manuscript. `utils.R` contains utility functions. The code reads data from `../data` and saves data/output to other directories (see parent directory and `README.md` for details).

The analyses were performed on R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31).
